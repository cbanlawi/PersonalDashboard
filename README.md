# PersonalDashboard
This project mimics the Momentum Dashboard Chrome extension. I used the Unsplash, CoinGecko, Geolocation, Open Weather Map and ESPN APIs to fetch different data and display them on my dashboard. You can use any APIs that you would like and choose whichever data you want to retrieve. The current time based on location is done in plain JS. The manifest.json file allows you to use it under your own personal chrome extensions.
